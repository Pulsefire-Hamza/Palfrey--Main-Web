          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold font-serif mt-8 mb-4">Use of Demographic and Profile Data</h2>

          <p>
            We use personal information to provide the services you request. We do not sell, rent, trade or exchange any
            personally-identifying information of our Users. We may provide your collected information to our affiliates

          <p>
            We may employ third parties' services to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business,
            product and service operations that we provide to you on the Site. Therefore we may provide some of your

            confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of your personal
            information for any other purpose.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may disclose personal information to third parties if required to do so by law or in the good faith
            belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal
            processes.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold font-serif mt-8 mb-4">Security Precautions</h2>

          <p>

            physical security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized access and
            disclosures. No security measures, however, are 100% complete.
          </p>

          <p>
            You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone and computer by, among
            other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows,
            and keeping your login and password private.
          </p>
